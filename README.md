Cavs Trivia Console Application

This is a Cavs Trivia Console Application using C#. Although it's not quite done yet, I plan to make this into a website so that anyone can try this. Currently, it's a console app. I created the questions myself and the questions are stored on a database. There is a Rest API which is where the application get's the questions from. I created it this way so that when I eventually learn how to connect the front end and the back end it would be a little easier.
